# Docker out of Docker Jenkins Slave

This repository is aimed to provide an example of a Docker Jenkins slave, using the Docker out of Docker concept (or "sibling" as explained at [Using Docker-in-Docker for your CI or testing environment? Think twice]( https://jpetazzo.github.io/2015/09/03/do-not-use-docker-in-docker-for-ci)) without giving users root access to the host.
